# Codecademy Portfolio Project

This Repository is my first Codecademy portfolio project. 
## Aim: 
To write a program that outputs a random selection of values and make it accessible for everyone on GitHub.
##Â My Solution:
I wrote a program that outputs a random meal and an alternative. To make it more interesting, I forked another Github repository (recipe-db) which contains a database of recipes used by http://xanthir.com/recipes/ . Now the program returns two random recipes from the database.

### Technology used:
- Github
- JavaScript
- JSON

### Launch:
Fork this repository and run it on your console with node.
